# Advance-Bash-With-Kitty-Ipsum-Translator

 Advanced Bash: Kitty Ipsum Translator

This project is part of the [freeCodeCamp Relational Database Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/). It demonstrates advanced Bash scripting techniques by building a translator for "Kitty Ipsum" text â€” a whimsical placeholder text, much like "Lorem Ipsum," but with cat-related content.
